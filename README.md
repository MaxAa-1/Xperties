Freelance Project Collaboration Website

This branch is dedicated to the components of the index page. 

Consists of the index page and a seperate feature on that page. 

Index page is the website's main page, where users is introduced to what our website actually does for them. 

The contact.php is for a feature when users can send feedback. When "Contact Us" is pressed, the user will be redirected to a contact page. When the "Send Message" button is clicked, the webste will prompt the user to log in, if user is logged in and the credentials are filled, the message will be sent and stored in the database, to be reviewed by the Host later on.
